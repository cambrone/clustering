Hierarchical and K-means clustering

This repository contains the code and data to reproduce my report " Exploratory Analysis of Educational Proficiency Data using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering." Exploratory analysis plays a crucial in helping social scientists build their regression models and test their theories. Unfortunately, few social science courses emphasize the usefulness of using clustering methods in the initial phase of data analysis. This report provides an example of how hierarchical clustering and k-means can help individuals understand patterns in the data and ultimately enhance their analysis. 

The project used data from elementary and middle schools in the state of New York. The data was retrieved from public databases, which are specified in the paper.  This report was completed entirely in R.

The project covers the theoretical concepts and applications of the following topics:

-	K-means clustering
-	Hierarchical clustering
-	Multidimensional Scaling
-	Dendrograms
-	Exploratory analysis with R
